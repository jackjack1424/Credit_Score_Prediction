The dataset consists of all the basic bank details of the customers, and the dataset has categorical and numerical variables. It has missing values and more anomalies. It consists of the customerâ€™s bank and processional details over the years so we can explore more of it. You have given the two data sets namely Train and Test datasets. I have used the TRAIN dataset to build and test the model. And used the Test dataset for my results.

Problem Statement:
You are working as a data scientist in a global finance company. Over the years, the company has collected basic bank details and gathered a lot of credit-related information. The management wants to build an intelligent system to segregate the people into credit score brackets to reduce manual efforts.

Objective:
The objective of this project is to explore the data to identify the pattern that causes the person to have a good or bad or standard type credit score and build a machine learning model that should be able to predict or classify the credit score type.
